Software Development project!

Description of our project: We made an iOS app that allows you to find recipes for mixed drinks based on the alcohol you select. The app was intended for college students (but anyone can use it) becuase college students tend to have a little knowledge on all the possiblilties they can create for mixed drinks. Within the app, you can save your favorite drinks or find new ones. 

How to run code: To run our code, you can open the source code in Xcode and use the built in simulator to see it in action.

Test Cases

Test case 1: Moving from the home screen to each of the second screens (choose a new drink, or choose a pre-existing drink from your favorites). To test this the user will click either button, if the user clicks the “Choose a New Drink” button, it will go to the page that gives the user the opportunity to choose a new alcohol from a scroll bar. The second button will be “View My Saved Drinks” where, once clicked, will bring the user to the page of that gives them a table view of there previously saved drinks. In order to show this works, we will use the Xcode simulator and show how each button works.

Test Case 2: After selecting the desired alcohol from the spinner the user will be presented with the drinks from the database which contain their specified alcohol. In order to test this we will use the Xcode simulator which is a fully functioning ios simulator in order to ensure that each of our database trees and queries are fully operational we must test each the output of each alcohol in against the database. 

Test Case 3: From the scroll bar, the user can choose an alcohol of their liking, and it should properly pull from the database recipes and drinks that go along with that alcohol. To show this works, we will run the Xcode simulator and show that each alcohol has its own recipes and that it is pulling from the database accurately.
